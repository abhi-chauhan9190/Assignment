Magical Arena

This project implements a simple Magical Arena simulation in Java.

Running the Code

Compile: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Java files. Compile them using:
                    javac MagicalArena.java Player.java MagicalArenaTest.java

Run: Once compiled, execute the program with:
                    java MagicalArenaTest

This will run the MagicalArenaTest file which contains different scenarios on which health , attack and strength values of the players depend.

Thankyou
